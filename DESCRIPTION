Description: Obtain least-squares means for many linear, generalized linear, 
    and mixed models. Compute contrasts or linear functions of 
    least-squares means, and comparisons of slopes. 
    Plots and compact letter displays. Least-squares means were proposed in
    Harvey, W (1960) "Least-squares analysis of data with unequal subclass numbers",
    Tech Report ARS-20-8, USDA National Agricultural Library, and discussed
    further in Searle, Speed, and Milliken (1980) "Population marginal means 
    in the linear model: An alternative to least squares means", 
    The American Statistician 34(4), 216-221 <doi:10.1080/00031305.1980.10483031>.
    NOTE: Users are encouraged to switch to the 'emmeans' package,
    as 'lsmeans' will be archived in the not-too-distant future.
