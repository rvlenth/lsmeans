Description: This is the final standalone release of lsmeans. 
        The package has been renamed 'emmeans' (estimated marginal means) 
        where all future developments will take place.
        The final release of 'lsmeans' will be a wrapper for 'emmeans'; 
        'lsmeans' will eventually be removed from CRAN.
