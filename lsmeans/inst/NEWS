Changelog for 'lsmeans' package


2.17
    Removed unneeded import of 'Matrix' (could have done this in 2.12
        when I stopped using my own adaptation of 'pbkrtest' code)
    Bug fix for gls, lme, nlme objects with 'weights' argument
    Allows for character predictors in models as well as factors
    Exported selected S3 methods for lsm.basis and recover.data
        for use by other packages
    Added 'post.beta' slot in 'ref.grid' and 'lsmobj' classes;
        if not NA, holds sample from posterior of fixed effects.
        Also added 'as.mcmc' function to return posterior sample 
        of lsmeans when 'post.beta' has data
    Added support for 'MCMCglmm' and some 'mcmc' objects produced
        by the 'MCMCpack' package
    

2.16
    Added support for 'nlme' objects (for parameters in 'fixed')
        (and associated additional vignette example)
    Degrees of freedom now produced with lme and nlme objects
        (uses containment-like method)
    Addition of 'name' argument in 'contrast'
    Now built with byte-compiler enabled
    Bug fix in lstrends when there is a multivariate response
    Corrected error in annotation for Tukey-adjusted P values
    Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements


2.15
    Clarified annotations for Tukey and Scheffe-adjusted summaries
    Moved estimability code to a separate 'estmability' package
    Basic support for model objects in rms package
    Explicit non-support for gam (previously ran due to 
        inheritance, but produced the wrong results!)


2.14
    Model weights are now used instead of frequencies when weights 
        are not "equal"
    Fixed error in 'lstrends' when 'specs' is two-sided formula
    Added more/better references for LS means
    Yet more enhancements for for clm, clmm, polr...
        "mean.class" mode, uses response name for "prob" mode
        "scale" mode does lsmeans for estimated log-scale
    Enhancements to 'weights' argument in 'lsmeans':
        - May now provide a matrix - it cycles through its rows
        - weights = "show.levels" shows the factor comb's averaged
    Added 'reverse' option to 'pairs'
    Added 'type' argument in 'ref.grid' for convenience
    Fixed some errors/omissions in documentation of 'update'
    One-sided 'tail' spec now applies to CIs as well as tests
    New adjustment methods added:
        "mvt" provides exact one-step methods like Tukey, Dunnett
        "dunnettx" is approximate and only available for 2-sided cases
    Added contrast fcns "tukey" and "dunnett" - these are pseudonyms
        for "pairwise" and "trt.vs.ctrl" resp.
    More adjustments are available for confidence intervals
    Tries harder to use only appropriate adjust methods
    New 'estType' attribute for 'update' related to the above
    'cld' accommodates when 'multcompView' isn't installed, thus
        can still pass checks without that package
    Removed .old.lsmeans and associated vignette


2.13
    Provides for equivalence, noninferiority, etc. tests via
        'side' and 'delta' arguments in 'summary' or 'test'. Also
        for non-zero null values via 'null'
    Added support for ordinal package objects 'clm', 'clmm'
    Option 'mode' added for 'polr' objects, defaulting to "latent".
        NOTE - NEED TO SET 'mode = "linear.predictor" TO REPRODUCE 
        PAST RESULTS FOR 'polr' OBJECTS.
    nlme and lme4 moved to 'Enhances' field for consistency
    ### Added limited support for mer objects (lme4.0 package)
    ### I dropped this because it messes-up the CRAN checks
    Added 'adjustSigma' option for 'lme' objects 
        (works like in 'summary.lme')
    Fixed error in handling offsets for 'polr' objects
    Fixed error in omitting modeled covariates when there was a 
        multivariate response.
    Fixed bug in 'contrast' that failed to update 'pri.vars'
        which, e.g., creates an error in a subsequent plot
    Fixed bug in plot - it had ignored xlab when horizontal = FALSE
    In lsmip with type = "response", the vertical axis is
        now labeled with misc$inv.lbl when available
    Removed frequencies and offsets from row labels in 'as.glht'
    Fixed 'as.glht' so df may be omitted or set to NA for asymptotics
    Renamed the 'parm' argument in 'test' to 'null'
    Removed superfluous "P values are asymptotic" messages. 
    Revision to function producing estimates, SEs, and df
    Added provision to specify 'estHook' and 'vcovHook' in 'misc' slot
        to allow for custom routines for estimates and covariances.
    '.is.estble' is renamed 'is.estble' -- exported and documented.
    The 'by' variable for 'test' now also works when 'joint = TRUE'


2.12
    *** Developers supporting lsmeans please note:            ***
    *** Change to lsm.basis prototype: Added a "..." argument ***
    Removed own patch for df from pbkrtest in favor of its Lb_ddf. 
        This means you must have pbkrtest 0.4-1 or newer
    Added 'plot.lsmobj' method to display confidence intervals
    These plots also optionally can display comparison arrows
        that attempt to display significance of pairwise comparisons
        according to their degree of overlap
    Added 'joint' argument to 'test'
    Fixed a bug in vcov
    Modified 'auto.noise' so 'side' has levels 'L' and 'R'
        rather than 'R' and 'L' (so not in reverse position in plots!)
    Added support for:
        gee, geeglm, and geese objects (gee, geepack);
        glmmadmb objects (glmmADMB);
        mixed objects (afex)
    Added 'lsmobj' function to construct an lsmobj from 
        summary statistics
    Overhauled 'lsmeans-package' help page to provide an overview
        with links to key functions, and integrated details of 
        model-specific implementation in a new 'models' help page

2.11
    Added vcov method for ref.grid
    Added 'weights' argument for lsmeans - may be numeric, or 
        the string "equal", "proportional", "outer", or "cells"
    Enhanced 'cov.reduce' argument in 'ref.grid' to allow formulas,
        useful when you think covariates depend on other variables.
        Also, when cov.reduce is a list, it may now include 
        anything -- function, logical, or formula
    Additional dataset 'feedlot'
    Now 'cld' does not break when there are non-estimable lsmeans
    Fixed situation where one error message masks another more
        informative one
    Added possibility of 'summary=' spec for lsm.options, which
        sets defaults for summary, predict, and lsmip
    Improvements/updates to vignettes
    Minor coding/efficiency improvements
    Removed 'df' arg for ref.grid, stupidly added in 2.10 
        (we can set df as part of 'options' arg)

2.10
    Support for 'aovlist' objects (does intra-block analysis)
        To use, avoid contr.treatment; use contr.sum or other that sums to 0
    Added 'contrast', 'test', 'pairs', 'confint', 'cld' methods for
        lsmlist, with 'which' argument defaulting to 1
    Added 'disable.pbkrtest' option (via lsm.options) if you don't want
        bias correction and K-R degrees of freedom with lmerMod objects
    Added 'df' argument to 'ref.grid' constructor, also 'summary' and 
        'update'.

2.05
    Corrected error in Tukey-adjusted confidence intervals
    New dataset 'oranges'
    Completely revised, improved vignette 'using-lsmeans'
    New vignette 'extending lsmeans'
    New 'mult.name' argument in 'ref.grid'
    New 'lsm.options' function and associated support for 
        setting display defaults for various objects
    Improved estimability checking and ability to set the 
        tolerance via lsmeans.options(estble.tol = ...)
    Added estimability support for merMod, now that lme4
        supports rank-deficient models
    Miscellaneous small improvements to code and datasets

2.00-5
    Additional message showing what factors have been averaged over
    Now adds offsets to predictions when model contains
        offset() terms (but not for an 'offset' argument)
    New 'update' method for "ref.grid" objects
    Broader support for transformations (see ?update.ref.grid)
    Changed all S3 methods for "lsmobj", except 'show', to S3
        methods for the "ref.grid" class, since they all work
        just fine for this class as well.
    Added an example for 'lstrends'
    Removed unneeded misc$ylevs element in ref.grid objects
    New way to bypass unneeded package-loading from pbkrtest
    Added an example for lstrends as there wasn't one
    Fixed minor bug in summary() - a try() call should have been 
        with silent=TRUE

2.00-4
    Reverted to code that just loads pbkrtest and its required 
        (but unneeded) packages when pbkrtest is needed

2.00-3
    Slight change in use of attach() in lsm.basis.merMod

2.00-2
    Added some support for adjusted confidence limits
    Minor bug fix to make recover.data work with more gls models
    Fewer unneeded packages are loaded

2.00-1
    Fixed a minor formatting issue in a vignette

2.00-0
    This is a major redesign of the package. Single function 'lsmeans'
    is replaced by methods for different types of models and 
    specifications, and returns an 'lsmobj' rather than a 'data.frame'.
    New functions 'ref.grid', 'contrast', 'lstrends', and new 'summary',
    'confint', 'test', 'glht', 'cld' methods for 'ref.grid' and 'lsmobj'
    objects. See the vignette "lsmeans-changes" for more details.
    This version is easily extensible to various types of model objects, 
    and several more are supported such as survreg, coxph, polr.
    There is also full support for na.actions, and for back-transforming
    results when a response is transformed or a link function is used.

1.10-4
    Fixed bug in cld spec that caused multiple letter columns

1.10-3
    Added cld capability
    Fix to lsmip so factor levels are not re-ordered
    Added new dataset: 'auto.noise'
    Fixed problem in documentation link to another package

1.10-2
    Added simple support for models with a multivariate response
    Bug fix for case when only one contrast is specified
    Examples that use lme4 package are made conditional per CRAN requirements
        since lme4 version 1.0-4 and later depend on a non-portable package
    Dependency modifications to meet CRAN requirements. Includes adding
        multcomp as required package, since we enhance glht

1.10-01
    Now works again for 'gls' objects

1.10-00 
    Added contrast families for effects and "deleted effects"
    Added "scheffe" option for 'adjust' argument
    Added lsmip function (interaction plots)
    Fixed Tukey-adjusted P values for d.f. near 2. 
        (Note: ptukey does not work when there are less than 2 d.f.)
    Allow covariates in 'specs' formula (also allows covariates to
        have multiple levels and be part of the reference grid that
        is averaged over in determining LS means)
    Allow cov.reduce to be logical - mostly to implement a 'unique' option
    No d.f. or adjusted covariance matrix for GLMMs (questionable validity, 
        plus pbkrtest won't play along)
    Now checks lengths of contrast coef's for conformity
    Fixed a bug in estimability checking (occurred when qr.R does not 
        return a square matrix)
    Efficiency improvements. Now requires 'plyr' package

1.06-06 - June 13, 2013
    Added support for lmerMod objects (gitHub version of lme4)

1.06-05 - February 13, 2013
    Fixed a bug whereby unused levels of factors can create havoc.

1.06-00 - January 14, 2013
    Added a 'trend' argument for estimating and contrasting fitted trends
        rather than lsmeans

1.05-01 - December 5, 2012
    Fixed a bug that occurs when model contains expressions like (a + b + c)^2
        or other expressions that expand to interaction terms

1.05-00 - November 2, 2012
    Added an 'lf' boolean argument to return the matrices of linear functions
        without evaluating them
    Added a function 'lsm' and corresponding method for 'glht'; thus, now we
        can use lsm() much like mcp()
    Changed examples with glht to integer df -- due to a recent change in mvtnorm
        glhargs$df is coerced to an integer before passing, but in lsm() it is
        up to the user to pass appropriate arguments to glht


1.00-00 - October 19, 2012
    Added support for factors in 'at' argument (can use it to restrict results)
    Added columns with factor levels to lsmeans table - for possible use in plots
    Extended trt.vs.ctrl.lsmc to accommodate more than one reference level
        (Thanks to Florent Duyme, ARVALIS - Institut du v?g?tal, for suggesting this)
    Refinements to print methods, including new class 'data.frame.lsm' to display 
        results the way I want them
    If 'glhargs' is used, those elements are now of class 'summary.glht'. 
        We can still use those results in the same ways as before
    Added support for adjustment methods in 'p.adjust' (stats)
    Included a couple of sample datasets
    Various small bug fixes (e.g. subsets bug)


0.99-80 - September 19, 2012
    Now finds degrees of freedom when appropriate for all but lme objects
        (For mer objects, get df only if 'pbkrtest' installed)
    lsmeans tables now show confidence intervals instead of t tests
        and contrast output shows p values (both assuming df are available)
    Added a 'conf' argument for confidence level in lsmean intervals
    Added a 'glhargs' argument; if provided, lsmeans passes its contrasts 
        to the 'glht' function in the 'multcomp' package
    Added an 'adjust' argument for popular single-step multiplicity corrections
        (uncorrected, Tukey, Bonferroni, and Sidak)
    Contrast-generating functions now produce an 'adjust' attribute which 
        provides a default multiplicity-adjustment method
    The 'check.cells' argument is now deprecated. Instead, we do an actual 
        check of estimability in rank-deficient cases (currently can happen 
        only with 'lm' objects). This check is not optional
    Renamed the vignette to avoid confusion with the regular documentation
    Returned object is now assigned class "lsm" which has its own print method.


0.99 - August 27, 2012
    Now can handle predictors coerced to 'factor' or 'ordered'
    Now can handle predictors deleted due to rank deficiency
    Now can handle models with matrices among the predictors
        (uses 'cov.reduce' on each column; 'at' not supported for matrix covariate)
    Added support for gls objects (and documented that it works also for glm and glmer)
    Added a check for empty cells in the design (relative to the model). This (by default)
        forces a NA to be outputted for any lsmeans that are corrupted by rank deficiencies
    Generates a warning if specified factor(s) interact with other predictors
    Better and more comprehensive vignette
    Added a whole lot of comments to the code (you won't see these, but be glad,
        as it greatly aids maintainability)
    Added error messages for anticipatable user errors
    Numerous bug fixes and corrections to documentation
    Still no d.f. or P values. Those could take awhile.
    
0.90 - August 14, 2012
    First release, still needs some refinements and bullet-proofing
