\title{
Least-squares means
}
\description{
This package provides methods for obtaining so-called least-squares means for factor combinations in a variety of fitted linear models. It can also compute contrasts or linear combinations of these least-squares means, (several standard contrast families are provided), and in addition can estimate and contrast slopes of trend lines.
Popular adjustments for multiple-comparisons are provided, as well as graphical ways of displaying the results.

Almost the entire codebase for \pkg{lsmeans} now resides in the \pkg{emmeans} package 
(named for the more general term, \dQuote{estimated marginal means}). \pkg{lsmeans} exists only as a transitional entity for the few remaining packages that depend on it.
